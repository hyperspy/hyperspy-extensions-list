This repository contains a list of [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org)
extensions. HyperSpy extensions are packages that use the HyperSpy extension
mechanism to add functionality to HyperSpy (such as GUI widgets) and/or
register new subclasses of HyperSpy objects (such as components and signals).

# Adding a HyperSpy extension to the list
